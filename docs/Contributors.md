## krom

Thank you for your indisposable clean-room, micro-test **ROMs**.

These, especially the **RSP** vector **ROMs**, have saved me hours of hair-pulling.

And, with my impatience, there's no way I would have <br>
ever come close developing something so intricate.

## Iconoclast

Although we hardly ever see eye-to-eye with regards to <br>
development practices, your zilmar-spec **RSP** plugin was <br>
instrumental to getting **CEN64** to the point where it is today.

Without a basis of comparison, the initial SSE-ification of the **RSP** <br>
algorithms would have been even more testing than it already was.

## [mikeryan]

For single-handedly implementing virtually all of the save-related <br>
bits and pieces, fixing hard-to-catch **PIF** bugs, your work on the <br>
**SM5**, **OSX** fixes, advice on locking down `cen64.com`, and all the <br>
other help you've provided.

*Consider this message to be an effective coupon for a beer on me!*

## OzOnE / [LuigiBlood]

For your fantastic documentation and efforts on reversing the **64DD**. <br>
Without your efforts, there's no way that **CEN64** would have **64DD** support.

## izy           

For all your optimization work - from <br>
the `VR4300` to **RSP**, audio, and beyond!

**CEN64's** performance on `x86` has improved due to your work!

## jrra

For your work on **MBC3** / transfer <br>
pak and the various other things <br>
you've done to help the project!

## simer & Snowstorm64

Thanks for your work on the cart database!

Whether it be populating entries, <br>
shifting from the use of cart title to <br>
cart ID, or adding additional save types

---

## AIO          

Thank you for your **RSP** / **SSE** optimizations.

It's always nice to see someone else's approaches <br>
to vectorizing some of the **RSP** instructions!

# n64dev        

Thank you to everyone else that's helped out in the past: <br>
`marshallh`, `balrog`, and anyone else that I'm forgetting.

<br>

A project aiming to ***perfectly*** replicate the **N64** by emulating <br>
it's hardware down to the **RTL**, the register-transfer level.

At the same time **CEN64** is continually being optimized to hopefully <br>
someday run **ROMs**, at full speed, even on modest systems.

## Why

> CEN64 is my pet project. It's something I pick up whenever I get bored. <br>
> To me, what Nintendo and SGI did with this console is nothing short of amazing. <br>
>
> The ingenuity and design of the hardware was well-ahead of it's <br>
> time, and it is an absolute blast to reverse-engineer and study.
>
> I started this project in order to learn more about what *really* <br>
> went on at the hardware level back in the (good old) days.

> Thank you to every single one of you developers <br>
> for filling my childhood with excellent memories.

> I'd also like to thank the community on all their hard work <br>
> and effort spent reverse-engineering this little gem.
>
> Without further ado... "Get N or get out"!
